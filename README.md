## Scripts for bulk downloading wallpapers from various sources

### Providers Implemented

- [ ] [/r/wallpapers](https://reddit.com/r/wallpaprers)
- [ ] [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/)
- [ ] [nasa](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/)

As development continues, more providers will be added

In the future, I would like to turn this into a wallpaper aggregator.
Something similar to wallhaven.
